# Scholarly Awards Management System

## Summary

This is the code that powers the [Scholarly Awards Management System] (https://awardsmanagement.herokuapp.com/).

This system allows users to keep a record of all of their scholarly grant applications. It features a filestore to store relevant documents in a central location. Additionally, it allows users to generate Current & Pending forms using any custom .docx template. Finally, users can download all information as a CSV for personal customization and use.

## Third-Party Services

The system uses a second worker Ruby app hosted on Heroku to process requests for Current & Pending form creation.

Static hosting services are provided by [AWS S3] (https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).
  
The site is hosted on [Heroku] (heroku.com).

The table is sorted using [Tablesorter] (https://github.com/Mottie/tablesorter).

Styling uses [normalize.css] (https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) and [Bootstrap] (https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap).
